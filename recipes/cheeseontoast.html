    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheese on toast is a very quick and easy dish that tastes great. <strong>Got bread? Got cheese? Got heat? Let's go!</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1x slice of bread</li>
        <li>1x slice of cheese</li>
        <li>sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get your bread to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Slice enough cheese to cover one side of the bread but do not keep the cheese applied, move it to one side.</li>
        <li>Place enough foil to host your bread on the oven rack and preheat to 180 degrees celsius.</li>
        <li>Then, place your bread on the foil and let it cook until the top side is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Next, flip the bread over and apply the cheese to the un-toasted side.</li>
        <li>Leave it cook for another few minutes until the cheese starts to lightly bubble (watch carefully).</li>
        <li>Finally remove your cheese on toast from the oven and leave it cool off for a couple of minutes before eating.</li>
    </ol>
